# Vanilla_JS_Memory_Test \_Game

> This game will test a player's recall skills. It's a classic Simon Says game but in this version, a player has to match a random pattern generated in precisely.

## Game development

> The game was developed using vanilla JavaScript, and no API was used.


## How to play the game

![main page](screenShot.png)

> The way to play the game is to match the prompts generated by the code. As soon as the game starts, one of the squares on the board will flash, and the player is required to match the order in which the square flashes. Each correct cycle of guesses is awarded a point. The game grows in complexity as it progresses.

## How the game was coded (Code explained)

> The code was written in vanilla JavaScript(JS). Once a conceptual design sketched on a word processing document was approved, the game's code was planned by breaking it down to a series of small game functions, which when combined, would render the game playable. Planning for the code and keeping tabs of th eto-do list of code was done through a Trello board [linked](https://trello.com/b/d5CAAMGT/memory-game) here.
> The board was built using 6 divs tags in html. Event listeners were then utilized which were attached to each div using a for loop. The functionality was rendered playable using arrays. The step by step explanation of how the code works is:

- As soon as the page is loaded, 2 arrays empty arrays are initialized and a function that generates a random number between 1 and 6 is then pushed into the pattern array

- Another function that adds the an event listener to each square of the game adds and then removes the class using a setTimeOut function creating the blink or flash seen

- Another function, which is the main game function then allows the player to attempt to match the pattern generated, each click stores the index number that is associated with teh clicked squre in an array.

- Once the player attempts to match the array, and the length of the generated and the player array is similar, the array is parsed into a string and compared. If both the arrays are equal elements in the same index, the player array is cleared, another random number generated and the score incremented by 10. If the arrays are not the same the code displays an alert with the score and the game is then restarted.

## Challenges faced

> The most challenging aspect was getting the generated pattern to flash on the screen. Using DOM manipulation a class was added and removed from each square when a random pattern was generated as well as when the player entered their pattern. To visualize the effect time out function was used. The challenging aspect was getting the timimng and syncing of the function to make the game visually appealing.
