# MAaaPlaylist

## About the app
> The app is a playlist organization tool that allows users to curate personalized playlists. Users must authenticate via Google OAuth to gain access to the app and their created playlists. Without authentication, visitors will be restricted to onlu using the song search feature along with the ability to view public playlists.

## Naming the app
> The app's name was conceived as a playful pun, incorporating the goat as an inspirational animal and featuring it in the app's logo. The "MAaa" segment of the name represents the characteristic call of a goat, resembling the sound "my" as well. Thus, instead of "my playlist," the "my" is humorously replaced with "MAaa," resulting in the name MAaaplaylist.

## Development Outline

> The site was developed using the Express JS framework. A dedicated API was used to fetch songs and their details. User are able to add songs to their playlist. The site was developed and designed using the conceptualized ERD below. The ERD has three entities (Playlist, Song, and User) connected with two relationships (Playlist - Song and User - Playlist).

**Users**

- The users will be able to log in on the platform by linking their Google account.

**Playlists**

- The site users can create multiple playlists to organize their favorite songs
- Each playlist has a name and a description to give context to its content.
- Users can add songs to their playlists. The songs attribute in the Playlist entity stores references (ObjectIds) to the songs included in the playlist.

**Songs**

- Each song has a name, genre, artist(s), release year, and cover art.
- Genres and artists are stored as arrays of strings, allowing a song to be associated with multiple genres and artists if necessary.
- The cover attribute stores a URL or file path pointing to the cover art for the song.
